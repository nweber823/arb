                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-card">
                        <h4>Event Impact Model</h4>
                        <p>Predicts the impact of corporate events, earnings announcements, and other significant developments on pair relationships and trading signals.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Statistical Arbitrage Focus</h2>
                <p>The core of our enhanced strategy remains statistical arbitrage, leveraging comprehensive historical price data to identify persistent statistical relationships between securities. Key improvements include:</p>

                <ul>
